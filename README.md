# BehaviourTreeEditor
Behaviour Tree Editor built for Unity

This developer tool was created to assist designers in creating unique behaviours for AI agents using a simple set of nodes.

Includes functionality for:
- fallback nodes
- sequence nodes
- action nodes

You can see a short (~10 min) demo [here](https://youtu.be/PKJ8B0WJEuM)

The idea of behaviour trees is to create complex AI behaviour by using and reusing the same nodes in different ways. New action nodes can be added for specific tasks and are linked together with the control flow nodes (selector, and fallback)


This was built for Intro to AI
